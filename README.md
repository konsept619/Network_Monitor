# What's this? 
This simple project can be interpreted as a sceleton of Zabbix. It provides similar functionality like **data collection**, **creation of database**, **testing connectivity (iperf3, ping)**. 
I made it as an introduction to monitoring and observability. 

# How to use Network Monitor?
## What are those files?
Provided scripts are written in Bash. They are supposed to: create MySQL DB, ping desired host and also check bandwidth between host and server.
## Installation process
There is no installation needed. You can just operate on files in directory. Initialize them in proper order and use collected data as you wish.
